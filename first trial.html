    <h1> Varujan Edwards</h1>
    <p> My name is Varujan Edwards, I'm on my third semester at hcc and my goal is to finish up my bs of computer science either at uconn, ccsu or sacred heart.
    My other goal would be to run track at either school or just mingling with peers to meet new people and or future networking opportunities.
